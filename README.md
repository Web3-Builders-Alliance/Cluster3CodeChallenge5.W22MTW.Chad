Coding Challenge

- [x] Inside of cw3-fixed-multisig integration tests create a 3 of 5 multisig
- [ ] It should control the counter contract, write a test that creates a proposal to increment the contract and then vote on it
- [ ] Query the counter contract and assert that the count has incremented.
- [ ] Once that proposal has passed add a new proposal to the test to reset the counter and then vote on that as well,
- [ ] Query the counter contract again and assert that the count has been reset
- [ ] You can use the provided `w3_controls_cw20` to help build out the test for the counter
